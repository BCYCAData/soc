			take action and rebound more quickly following an emergency. Relationships are key, they build
			community strength. We can make a difference by working together.

		<h3 class="h3">WHAT ARE KYNGS? - Know Your Neighbour Groups</h3>
		<p class="my-2">
			KYNGs are smaller groups within the community and live on adjoining roads. These groups focus
			on connections and strengthening two-way communication lines. In an emergency, messages to
			KYNG co-ordinators can be shared with their group and critical information shared with
			emergency services.
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			KYNG Co-ordinators will initially gather and share information, create connections and
			relationships. Who knows where else this can go?
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			One size doesnâ€™t suit all, so we will provide a very simple structure and allow the group
			itself to decide on the best methods of sharing information for them.
		</p>
		<h3 class="h3">KYNG Co-ordinator Role</h3>
		<ol class="mt-0 list-inside list-disc">
			<li class="m-1">Connect with the people in your area.</li>
			<li class="m-1">
				Explain what KYNGs are and why they are important - sharing information (two-way flow),
				supporting each other in an emergency, providing information to emergency services.

			<li class="m-1">Collect and keep up to date contact info.</li>
			<li class="m-1">Agree with group most suitable methods of passing information.</li>
